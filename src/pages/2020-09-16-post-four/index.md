### A Long Path I Took to Raise Political Awareness

What is American Politics? What does it mean of being political? How important is it to build political awareness? 

As a Chinese Chinese, I had little interest in learning politics in my own country, although political science is a required course for all students in China and people do register to vote for regional representatives, but as we all know, it's a one-party regime estabilished country, and in my eyes, my voting wouldn't barely make any changes on who would be the next president. Plus, I went study abroad after the year when I turned 18, and therefore, I barely had a chance to vote during my teenager years living in China. Part of me feels knowing politics has little to do with making changes through voting, and the other part of me simply do not possess concrete concepts about diversity, because when I grew up in China during 1990s-2000s, believe it or not, where everyone living around me is Chinese. I've been taught in school that equal rights should be shared among people regardless of their biological or social background, and my parents have been encouraging me to pursue anything I want to do just as boys do, but it was substantially difficult for me to put my feet in and fight for ratification of equal rights among races and colors without concrete context around me.   

When I first came to US for College in 2011, it was the first time that I learned the word "diversity", which indicates in American society, each individual is unique in terms of race, color, religion, gender and sexual orientation. By that time, I made friends with different backgrounds and I built my own fundamental understanding that everyone should be treated equally regardless of their individual differences. Somehow I barely discussed openly about politics with my American friends, and my reflection on this might be because politics by itself is a sensitive topic to talk about at anytime and as a foreigner, it was difficult for me to build my political view without raising enough awareness with a lack of understanding on American history and social society. While I was in college, I learned the word "Fobby" (fresh-off-boat) for the first time from my friends and we made jokes on me being fobby drinking boba all the time -- I mean "we" not "they" because I never took it in an offensive way and felt it was just funny jokes made between friends.  To some extent, I was not politically sensitive at all, and I had always been setting myself in a position to embrace the American culture, and to stay positive for cultural shocks.   

What made me really think about building political awareness is my recent short-lived relationship which ended because the person I dated with couldn't trust me and felt embarrassed introducing me to his friends due to my political ignorance. Without fully understanding the behind-scene meaning of "Black Lives Matter" (BLM), I once made bad jokes in front of him by saying something which now sounds super disrespectful as "Asian Lives Matter", "White Lives Matter", "All Lives Matter" etc. What I originally meant is definitely not to hurt anyone, but was trying to express my fundamental belief that everyone should be treated equally no matter of their races, colors, religions, genders or sexual orientations, but I realized soon that these are actually quite offensive and disrespectful words and made people feel uncomfortable. I didn't put my feet in others' shoes learning about all the miserable experience of how black/colored people had been treated unfairly for centuries, and people are using BLM to justify for them to be treated equally against systematic racial discrimination in American society. I had a hard time digesting the learned fact that the person I fell in love with had never trusted me enough to open up a political conversation with me, and it was a big hit to my self-esteem as if I was a savage person who lacks empathy for others. I had a dark time blaming myself over and over again because it's not anyone's responsibility but mine to educate myself on this, but I didn't do it properly. 

It's a hard lesson to learn, for being politically ignorant for myself and others at the same time, and it came a long way to set my mind to raise my political awareness. I know it won't be easy to build it from the ground up, and I would not give myself up. I'm not trying to prove it to anyone, I'm doing it for myself. 


### Get Started and It's Never Too Late to Learn!
Here comes to my actions. I have completed my first step by watching the crash course on [Political Science 101](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4sGpBHlQIiuf7FXUuANaRFbhEjpExywP) on YouTube. I highly recommend watching the whole series for beginners who do not have any prior knowledge on Politics, and I call it my Political Science 101 because it helps me understand fundamental but crucial concepts on how American government works, including political parties, interest group formation, constitution, civil rights & liberties, persidential power and discrimination etc.

Currently I just started off reading "Born A Crime", an autobiography book written by my favorite commedian Trevor Noah, and it helped me learn the Apartheid that he's experienced during his early childhood life in South Africa as a colored person. He has shown me with a strong heart and broad mind of identifying himself while living up in a community surrounded by Apartheid. I really love this book because it's interpreted some hard facts in a humourous way that Trevor is good at making, and he is the person that I wanted to be who can digest hard feelings inside, but still keeps a positive mind and a strong heart in embracing life. 

I'm planning to learn American History at the same time, which I believe is also a good starting point to learn the making of Americans and the pattern of American socienty forms. I'm learning it by watching [US History Lessons](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbl_9QJosR54t0XZSXQIYzmuRQ2r0xc4T) on YouTube, and so far I feel it's pretty interesting and I hope this will help me have a deeper and wider root understanding of the past and make it flow through things that I encounter in present life. 

I'm trying to take one small step at a time and being selective on materials to watch and learn with a hope to build enough political awareness. I know change doesn't happen overnight, but I'm being determined to learn and grow to be a better version of me.
