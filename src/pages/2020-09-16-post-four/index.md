### The Path I Took from Being Political Ignorant

What is American Politics? What does it mean of being political? How important is it to build political awareness? 

As a Chinese Chinese, I had little interest in learning politics in my own country, although political science is a required course for all students in China and people do register to vote for regional representatives, but as we all know, it's a one-party regime estabilished country, and in my eyes, my voting wouldn't make any changes on who would be the next president. Part of me feels knowing politics has little to do with making changes through voting, and the other part of me simply do not possess any concepts about diversity, because when I grew up in China during 1990s-2000s, believe it or not, everyone living around me is Chinese, although I believe things have changed a bit with more international integration in recent years. 

When I first came to US for College in 2011, it was the first time that I learned the word "diversity", which indicates in American society, each individuals could have their own race, color, religion, gender and sexual orientation. By that time, I built my own fundamental understanding that everyone should be treated equally regardless of their individual differences. I made friends with different backgrounds, but somehow we never discussed openly about politics, weird. Maybe they assume that I'm a foreigner that I probably don't know much about politics, and besides that, politics by itself is a sensitive topic to talk about at anytime. I learned the word "Fobby" (fresh-off-boat) from my friends and we made jokes on me being fobby -- I mean "we" not "they" because to me, it was just jokes made between friends and I didn't feel offended at all. During my college life, I embraced myself and tried hard in getting involved in the American culture, although I constantly felt more comfortable hanging out with my Chinese friends since we share similar culture and speak Chinese to each other, without thinking of seeking for exact words for translations. 

What made me really thinking about building political awareness is my recent short-lived relationship which ended because the person I dated with couldn't trust me and felt embarrassed introducing me to his friends due to my political ignorance. Without fully understanding the behind-scene meaning of "Black Lives Matter" (BLM), I once made bad jokes in front of him by saying something which now sounds super disrespectful as "Asian Lives Matter", "White Lives Matter", "All Lives Matter" etc. What I originally meant is definitely not to hurt anyone, but was trying to express my fundamental belief that everyone should be treated equally no matter of their races, colors, religions, genders or sexual orientations, but I realized soon that these are actually quite offensive and disrespectful words and made people feel uncomfortable. I didn't put my feet in shoes learning about all the miserable experience of how black people had been treated unfairly for a long history since colonization, and people are using BLM to justify for black people to be treated equally against systematic racial discrimination in American society. It made me feel awful at one point that as if I was a savage person who lacks empathy for others, but after cooling down, I know from the bottom of my heart, I have deep caring for human rights and social justice. As a foreigner, I do not have voting rights in elections, but I gradually learned that building political awareness is essential, and it is not just about American government and voting rights, but more about raising up political awarenss and community empathy, and it's both my social responsibility and rights to make world a better place.


### Get Started and It's Never Too Late to Learn!
So I made up my mind in building my political awareness, and I have completed my first step by watching the crash course on [Political Science 101](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4sGpBHlQIiuf7FXUuANaRFbhEjpExywP) on YouTube. I highly recommend watching the whole series for beginners who do not have any prior knowledge on Politics, and I call it my Political Science 101 because it helps me understand fundamental but crucial concepts on how American government works, including political parties, interest group formation, constitution, civil rights & liberties, persidential power and discrimination etc.

Currently I just started off reading "Born A Crime", an autobiography book written by my favorite commedian Trevor Noah, and I would like to learn more about Apartheid that he's experienced during his early childhood life in South Africa. I would come back and write my feedback after finishing this book. 

I'm trying to take one small step at a time and being selective on materials to watch and learn with a hope to build enough political awareness. I know change doesn't happen overnight, but I'm being determined to learn and grow to be a better version of me.
