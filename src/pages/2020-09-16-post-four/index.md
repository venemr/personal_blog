I wrote this down in my blog because I would like to share my own experience and learnings as an immigrant who might not know much about American Politics, and help people like me to fight through similar struggles.

### A Long Path I Took to Raise Political Awareness

What is American Politics? What does it mean of being political? How important is it to build political awareness? 

As a Chinese Chinese, I had little interest in learning politics in my own country, although political science is a required course for all students in China and people do register to vote for regional representatives, but as we all know, it's a one-party regime established country, and in my eyes, my voting would barely make any changes on who would be the next president. Plus, I went to study abroad in the year when I turned 18, and therefore, I barely had any chance to vote during my teenage years living in China. Part of me feels knowing politics has little to do with making changes through voting, and the other part of me simply does not possess concrete concepts about diversity, because when I grew up in China during the 1990s-2000s, believe it or not, everyone living around me is Chinese. I've been taught in school that equal rights should be shared among people regardless of their biological or social background, and as a girl, my parents have been encouraging me to pursue anything I want just as boys do, but it was substantially difficult for me to put my feet in and fight for ratification of equal rights among races and colors without individual living context around me.   

When I first came to the US for college in 2011, it was the first time that I learned the word "diversity", which indicates in American society, each individual is unique in terms of race, color, religion, gender, and sexual orientation. By that time, I made friends with different backgrounds and I built my fundamental understanding that everyone should be treated equally regardless of their differences. Somehow I barely discussed openly politics with my American friends, and my reflection on this might be because politics by itself is a sensitive topic to talk about at any time and as a foreigner, it was difficult for me to build my political view without raising enough awareness with a lack of understanding on American history and society. During hanging out with my American friends, I learned the word "Fobby" (fresh-off-boat) for the first time and we made jokes on me being fobby drinking boba all the time -- I mean "we" not "they" because I never took it offensively and felt it was just funny jokes made between friends.  To some extent, I was not politically sensitive to myself either, and my reflection on this is that I had always been setting myself in a position to embrace the American culture and to stay on the bright side for cultural shocks that I encountered.   

What made me think about building political awareness is my recent short-lived relationship which ended because the person I dated with couldn't trust me and felt embarrassed introducing me to his friends due to my political ignorance. Without fully understanding the behind-scene meaning of "Black Lives Matter" (BLM), I once made bad jokes in front of him by saying something which now sounds super disrespectful as "Asian Lives Matter", "White Lives Matter", "All Lives Matter" etc. What I originally meant is not intended to hurt anyone, but was just trying to express my fundamental belief that everyone should be treated equally regardless of their races, colors, religions, genders, or sexual orientations without overemphasizing and differentiating between who's the majority and who's the minority, but I realized soon that these are quite offensive and disrespectful words and made people feel uncomfortable. I didn't put my feet in others' shoes learning about all the miserable experiences of how black/colored people had been treated unfairly for centuries, and people are using BLM to justify for them to be treated equally against systematic racial discrimination in American society. I had a hard time digesting the learned fact that the person I fell in love with had never trusted me enough to open up a political conversation with me, and it was a big hit to my self-esteem as if I was a savage person who lacks empathy for others. I had a dark time struggling and blaming myself over and over again because it's not anyone's responsibility but mine to educate myself on this, but I didn't do it properly. 

There had been hard lessons that I learned, for being politically ignorant for myself and others in both ways, and it came a long way to set my mind to raise my political awareness. I know it won't be easy to build political awareness from the ground up, but I would keep learning it since I need and want to make this change internally to better interpret my caring and empathy about others and the community that I live in. 


### Get Started and It's Never Too Late to Learn!
Here comes to my actions. I have completed my first step by watching the crash course on [Political Science 101](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4sGpBHlQIiuf7FXUuANaRFbhEjpExywP) on YouTube. I highly recommend watching the whole series for beginners who do not have any prior knowledge on Politics, and I call it my Political Science 101 because it helps me understand fundamental but crucial concepts on how American government works, including political parties, interest group formation, constitution, civil rights & liberties, presidential power, and discrimination, etc.

Currently, I'm reading "Born A Crime", an autobiography book written by my favorite comedian Trevor Noah, and it helped me learn the Apartheid that he's experienced during his early childhood life in South Africa as a colored person. I'm impressed by his strong heart and broad mind of identifying himself while brought up in a community surrounded by Apartheid. I love his narration because Trevor is so good at interpreting some hard facts in a humorous way that made people laugh and think out loud at the same time, and he has the ability that I also stick to -- digesting hard feelings inside, but still keeping a positive mind and a kind heart in embracing all the encounterings that came into my life, to love, to learn, and to grow.   

I'm planning to learn American History at the same time, which I believe is also a good starting point to learn the making of Americans and the pattern of how American society forms. I'm learning it by watching [US History Lessons](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbl_9QJosR54t0XZSXQIYzmuRQ2r0xc4T) on YouTube, and so far I feel it's pretty interesting and I hope this will help me have a deeper and wider root understanding of the past of the US and have a well-rounded reflection on the present life. 

The other thing that I kept doing recently is to check out Twitter daily, and I feel it's super useful to learn from Trending News to keep an eye on what's happening in the US and read comments under popular tweets to learn about different opinions and voices about politics. 

I'm trying to take one small step at a time and being selective on materials to watch and learn with the hope to build enough political awareness one day. I know change doesn't happen overnight, but I'm being determined and optimistic (as always) to learn and grow to be a better version of myself.
