### #:christmas_tree: Mulled Wine #:christmas_tree:
<img src="/mulled_wine.jpg" alt="mulled wine img" width="700px">

#### Ingredients
* 1 whole fresh apple </br>
* 1 whole fresh orange </br>
* 1 whole fresh lemon </br>
* 2 cups of red wine </br>
    * prefer to use Merlot, Zinfandel or Garnacha because these wines are dark, fruity and full bodied </br>
    * avoid wines that are high in tannins or super oaky in flavor, such as Cabernet Sauvignon or light wine like Pinot Noir because they don't offer enough body to carry the spices. </br>
* whole spices: 1 whole cinnamon, 1 tar anise, 1 nutmeg and 2 bayleaves</br>
* two pieces of crystal sugar, make them into smaller pieces so it takes less time to melt</br>

#### Recipe 
**Step 1:** Prepare a 3.5-4 quart Le Creuset to cook the mulled wine in a medium heavy-bottomed spot. </br>
**Step 2:** Slice the lemon and orange into halves, and squeeze the juice from the half fresh lemon and orange into the pot. For the other halves, slice them into rounds and put them into the pot as well. </br>
**Step 3:** Slice the apple into pieces and put them into the pot. </br>
**Step 4:** Put the wine into the pot, followed by the sugars. Warm the mixture over small-to-medium heat until steaming for about 10 mins. Keep an eye on it, and when you start seeing the tiniest of bubbles at the surface, reduce the heat to the lowest of low. Never have it boiled. </br>
**Step 5:** Add whole spices into the pot, and warm it for another 5 mins, and turn off the heat. </br>
**Step 6:** Carefully taste, and add another tablespoon of sweetener if it's not sweet enough for your liking. If it's not spicy enough to suit your preferences, continue cooking over very low heat for another 5 mins. </br>
**Step 7:** Serve in a highball glass or a mug with your desired garnishes. You can add cranberries to make it look extra festive! </br>
