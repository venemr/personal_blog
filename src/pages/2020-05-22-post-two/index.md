I just started drawing using an app called "Procreate" on iPad to gain some innner peace and have fun during homestay under quarantine!

All I need is an apple pencil, which is much easier than buying a bunch of drawing supplies. 

I consider this as a hobby that I recently has built, and it's far from arts so don't judge if they look super naive to you since I have never learned professional drawing before. I'm taking small steps each time to improve my drawing skills.

### My first few paintings
I started with drawing some cute sushi's (寿司) and tempura's (天ぷら), then I drew a mermaid girl in a taro milk boba drink, which are both flat design and might be good to print as stickers. Afterwards, I tried something different and learned how to add light and shade effects by making bubbles.

### Galaxy Jar 
Recently I found a really cool youtuber [Gal Shir](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA1ZyvPnZ1D-3xlpCM6-CrQ) from whom I learned about handling stereo effect on paintings by following his tutorial. For now, I'm only trying to copy some of the paintings (Ghost and Galaxy Jar) that he had made to improve my skills as a beginner. Hopefully I can gradually learn to draw my own patterns and whatever came to my mind.

### Starry Night with Smoke 
I got my initial inspiration from Vincent Van Gogh's famous Starry Light painting to create my drawing to present a blurry night with orange and ashy sky, filled with wildfire smoke in Bay Area. It is a little depressing during the days when you can only sit indoors with windows shut down and live with air purifiers turned on for 7/24. The nature is showing us dangerous signs that climate change is real as each summer gets hotter and we as a community should take actions to protect our nature and reduce occurrence of wildfires.
