I just started drawing using an app called "Procreate" on iPad to gain some inner peace and have fun during homestay under quarantine!

All I need is an apple pencil, which is much easier than buying a bunch of drawing supplies. 

I consider this as a hobby that I recently has built, and it's far from arts so don't judge if they look super naive to you since I have never learned professional drawing before. I'm taking small steps each time to improve my drawing skills.

### My first few paintings
I started with drawing some cute sushi's (寿司) and tempura's (天ぷら), then I drew a mermaid girl in a taro milk boba drink, which are both flat design and might be good to print as stickers. Afterwards, I tried something different and learned how to add light and shade effects by making bubbles.

### Galaxy Jar 
Recently I found a really cool youtuber [Gal Shir](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA1ZyvPnZ1D-3xlpCM6-CrQ) from whom I learned about handling stereo effect on paintings by following his tutorial. For now, I'm only trying to mimic some of the paintings (Ghost and Galaxy Jar) that he had made to improve my skills as a beginner. Hopefully I can gradually learn to draw my own patterns and whatever came to my mind.

### Starry Night with Smoke 
I got my initial inspiration from Vincent Van Gogh's famous Starry Light painting to create my drawing to present a blurry night with orange and ashy sky, filled with wildfire smoke in Bay Area. It is a little depressing during the days when you can only sit indoors with windows shut down and live with air purifiers turned on for 7/24. The nature is showing us dangerous signs that climate change is real as each summer gets hotter and we as a community should take actions to protect our nature and reduce occurrence of wildfires.

### Watery Waves 
A practice painting to learn the usage of Distort and Gaussian Blur to create a 3D effect by drawing the watery waves with a penetration of sunlight. I think it's fun to explore new techniques occassionally to recharge and inspire myself. Also, I enjoy indulging myself in sky blue colors and it brings me with inner peace and soothing feelings when drawing this watery wave. #:blue_heart:

### First Trial in Making Illustrations
I've always wanted to try out illustration styled painting, and has been daydreaming to become an illustrator some day LOL. Here is my first trial in making a illustration doodling, and it is picturing a blue-haired girl who's watering her favorite plants at the window in a warmy sunday afternoon.
