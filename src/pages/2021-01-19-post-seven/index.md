Recently I have become obsessed with playing ukulele, and I found it is such an easy-to-learn music instrument (compared to violin haha), and I enjoy the chill and cheerfulness it brings to my quarantine life. I'd like to create this blog to catalog a running list of songs that I have been practicing for my own practice. Some are handwritten by me from Youtube watching and others are downloaded directly from ukulele professionals. 

At the meantime, I'm learning to edit short videos so hopefully I will be able to share my performance videos soon. Stay tuned! #:sunglasses:
