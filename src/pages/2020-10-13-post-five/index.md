Today when I first created this blog is during the 32nd week that we have been self-quarantined due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, and I don't know how many more weeks we have to stay self-isolated like this, maybe till the day when the vaccines finally come out in some undefined future. Living the quarantine life for seven months, I enjoy the privilege of working from home, since I could spare more time doing things I like, but meanwhile, the other part of me constantly feel upset about the accumulated Covid-19 case volume reaching nearly eight million, along with tremendous public health risk created and potential economic recession on the way. Two weeks ago, President Trump himself has also been diagnosed positive with Covid-19, but he kept telling people not to worry too much about the coronavirus, and it was obvious that he deliberately mitigated the severity of the coronavirus as his play-down strategy to cause "unnecessary" public anxiety, which turns out to be another foolish "Trump Trap" and is completely misleading to the public. Covid-19 is way more severe than it sounds like, and I have a strong belief that it requires coherent and coordinated efforts beyond single personnel, communities, and states to adopt a uniform approach to social distancing for months to fight through this Covid-19 Pandemic. However, what makes me frustrated is seeing the overconfidence among people who are still jeopardizing the compliance with social distancing and conjugating in the public area with their masks sometimes on and occasionally off, and a divided nation with a certain group of people maintaining self-awareness and high compliance of conducting social distancing measures, while with the other group of people going on various protests fueled with a crisis for democracy and freedom, by simply ignoring the cruel fact that hundreds of people are dying every day because of the coronavirus within this country. 


### How Different Countries Tackle Covid-19
Despite being the first place to be hit by Covid-19, China was managed to tackle the disease effectively. The federal government has enforced mandatory lockdowns and self-quarantine rules within the country to contain the virus spread. South Korea also made a rapid response by implementing drive-through diagnostic testing and mandatory contact tracing. In the US, so far there are at least 30 states with stay-at-home orders in place, which is great, but there are no strong enforcement policies that have been placed to make the order effective due to the high surveillance cost. Despite ample warnings from other countries, the US was still far from being prepared and is still struggling to have the coronavirus under control after seven months. I'm curious to understand why it is so challenging for the US to take effective actions to contain the virus spread, such as enforcing a national-wide mask-wearing and social-distancing rules, providing adequate testing facilities for the public, tracing contacts and notifying affected personnel, or placing federal fund for Covid-19 medical cost coverage etc. Given the fact that the US is one of the world's most powerful nations with ample resources and advanced technology, it is unbelievable that the nation shows so much more fragility and controversy than any other countries and can barely handle this situation in an effective way. Besides Trump Administration's failures to address the pandemic at the national level, is there other deep-rooted dysfunction, such as the US healthcare system that makes this nation lose the war on Covid-19?
