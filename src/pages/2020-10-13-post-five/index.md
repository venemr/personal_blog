Today when I first created this blog is the 32nd week that we have been self-quarantining ourselves during the Covid-19 Pandemic. I don't know how many more weeks we have to stay self-isolated like this, maybe till the vaccines come out in some undefined future. As an indoor person, I really don't mind not going to the office, and in fact I quite enjoy working from home, since I have more time for myself doing things I want, as a previleged person who still has her job. However, I have so much concern in mind about the continuously rising case volume, followed by tremendous public health issues and potential economic recessions in the US. Now President Trump has also been diagnosed positive with Covid-19, but he is still telling people not to worry too much about the coronavirus. But what I'm really worried is not about what Trump has said, but more about the overconfidence that I'm seeing on people who are breaking the quarantine rules and still hanging out with friends and families, with masks sometimes on and occasionally off, despite all the terrifying happenings on the other edge of the country, and hundreds and thousands of people dying every day due to coronavirus. It is the huge gap between how people feel and how people act, being scared of the coronavirus spread while still taking their own risks of breaking rules that really makes me upset.  


### How Different Countries Tackle Covid-19
Despite being the first place to be hit by Covid-19, China was managed to tackle the disease effectively. The federal government has enforced a mandatory lockdowns and self-quantine rules within the country to contain the virus spread. South Korea made rapid response by implementing drive-through diagnostic testing and mandatory contact tracing. US however, despite ample warnings, was far from being prepared, and is still struggling to have the coronavirus under control after 6 months. Besides the situation that many people constantly breaking the quarantine rules, I believe there are some deep-rooted dysfunction in the US healthcare system and government administration that make US as a nation to lose the war on Covid-19.
