Today when I first created this blog is during the 32nd week that we have been self-quarantined due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, and I don't know how many more weeks we have to stay self-isolated like this, maybe till the day when the vaccines finally come out in some undefined future. Living the quarantine life for six months, I actually enjoy the previlege of working from home, since I could spare more time doing things I like, but meanwhile, the other part of me constantly feel upset about the continuously rising case volume, followed by tremendous public health issues and potential economic recessions in the US. Two weeks ago, President Trump himself has also been diagnosed positive with Covid-19, but he kept telling people not to worry too much about the coronavirus, and it was obvious that he deliberately mitigated the severity of the coronavirus as his play-down strategy to comfort "unnecessary" public anxienty, which is just another foolish "Trump Trap" and is completely misleading. Covid-19 is way more severe than it sounds like, and I have strong belief that it requires coherent and coordinated efforts beyond single personnel, communities and states to adopt a uniform approach to social distancing for months to fight against the Covid-19. However, what makes me frustrated is seeing the overconfidence among people who are still jeopardizing the compliance with social distancing and conjugating with their masks sometimes on and occasionally off, and a divided nation with certain group of people maintaining self-awareness and high compliance of conducting social distancing measures, while with the other group of people going on protests against the violation of their democracy and freedom, by simply ignoring the cruel fact that hundreds of people are dying every day because of the coronavirus within this country. 


### How Different Countries Tackle Covid-19
Despite being the first place to be hit by Covid-19, China was managed to tackle the disease effectively. The federal government has enforced a mandatory lockdowns and self-quantine rules within the country to contain the virus spread. South Korea made rapid response by implementing drive-through diagnostic testing and mandatory contact tracing. In the US, so far there are at least 30 states with stay-at-home orders in place, which is great, but there are no strong enforcement policies that have been placed to make the order effective due to the high surveillance cost. Despite ample warnings from other countries, US was still far from being prepared, and is still struggling to have the coronavirus under control after 6 months. Why is it so challenging for US to contain the virus, given it's one of the most powerful nation equipped with the most advanced medical technology and expertise? Is there some deep-rooted dysfunction existed in the US healthcare system that makes US as a nation to lose the war on Covid-19?
