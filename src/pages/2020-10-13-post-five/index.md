Today when I first created this blog is during the 32nd week that we have been self-quarantined due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, and I don't know how many more weeks we have to stay self-isolated like this, maybe till the day when the vaccines finally come out in some undefined future. Living the quarantine life for seven months, I enjoy the privilege of working from home, since I could spare more time doing things I like, but meanwhile, the other part of me constantly feel upset about the accumulated Covid-19 case volume of nearly eight million, along with tremendous public health risk created and potential economic recession in the US. Two weeks ago, President Trump himself has also been diagnosed positive with Covid-19, but he kept telling people not to worry too much about the coronavirus, and it was obvious that he deliberately mitigated the severity of the coronavirus as his play-down strategy to comfort "unnecessary" public anxiety, which turns out to be another foolish "Trump Trap" and is completely misleading to the public. Covid-19 is way more severe than it sounds like, and I have a strong belief that it requires coherent and coordinated efforts beyond single personnel, communities, and states to adopt a uniform approach to social distancing for months to fight against the Covid-19. However, what makes me even more frustrated is seeing the overconfidence among people who are still jeopardizing the compliance with social distancing and conjugating with their masks sometimes on and occasionally off, and a divided nation with a certain group of people maintaining self-awareness and high compliance of conducting social distancing measures, while with the other group of people going on protests against the violation of their democracy and freedom, by simply ignoring the cruel fact that hundreds of people are dying every day because of the coronavirus within this country. 


### How Different Countries Tackle Covid-19
Despite being the first place to be hit by Covid-19, China was managed to tackle the disease effectively. The federal government has enforced mandatory lockdowns and self-quarantine rules within the country to contain the virus spread. South Korea also made a rapid response by implementing drive-through diagnostic testing and mandatory contact tracing. In the US, so far there are at least 30 states with stay-at-home orders in place, which is great, but there are no strong enforcement policies that have been placed to make the order effective due to the high surveillance cost. Despite ample warnings from other countries, the US was still far from being prepared and is still struggling to have the coronavirus under control after 6 months. I'm curious to understand why it is challenging for the US to contain the virus spread, because it seems there are various actions to take, such as enforcing a mandate national mask-wearing and social-distancing rules, providing adequate testing infrastructure, tracing affected contacts, placing federal fund for Covid-19 medical cost coverage, etc. Given the fact that the US is one of the world's most powerful nations with ample resources and advanced technology, it is unbelievable that the nation shows so much fragility and can barely handle this situation. Besides Trump Administration's failures to address the pandemic at the national level, is there other deep-rooted dysfunction, in the US healthcare system that makes this nation lose the war on Covid-19?
